🧠 AI Text Insight Analyzer (Azure AI Language Project)

This project is a simple AI-powered web application that analyzes text using Microsoft Azure AI Language Service.
It demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities from Azure can be integrated into a Python application and deployed as an interactive web app.

Users can enter any text and the application will return insights such as sentiment, detected language, key phrases, and named entities.

This project is built for learning and portfolio purposes to showcase Azure AI integration skills.

🚀 Project Overview
The application takes text input from the user and sends it to Azure AI Language Service for analysis.
Azure processes the text and returns structured insights which are displayed in the web interface.

This project shows an end-to-end workflow:
Text input → Azure AI processing → Insights displayed in UI.

✨ Features
The application provides the following NLP capabilities:
Language detection
Sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral)
Key phrase extraction
Named entity recognition (people, places, organizations, etc.)

These features are commonly used in real-world applications such as:
Customer feedback analysis
Chatbots
Review analysis
Business intelligence dashboards

💬 What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing technique used to determine the emotional tone of text.
The AI model classifies text into:
Positive
Negative
Neutral
Example:
“This product is amazing” → Positive
“The service was bad” → Negative
Businesses use sentiment analysis to understand customer opinions and improve services.

☁️ What is Azure AI Language Service?

Azure AI Language Service is a cloud-based AI service from Microsoft Azure that provides prebuilt Natural Language Processing capabilities.
It allows developers to analyze text without building machine learning models from scratch.
Capabilities include:
Language detection
Sentiment analysis
Entity recognition
Key phrase extraction
Text summarization

This project uses Azure AI Language Service to process user text and generate insights.
